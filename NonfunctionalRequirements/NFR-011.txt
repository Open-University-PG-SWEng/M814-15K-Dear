REQ-ID: NFR-011
Description: Tickets' unique identification numbers should note generate continuous series.
Type: Security
Rationale: It is important to prevent accidental or intentional misidentification of ticket.
Fit Criterion: Random change of ticket's unique identification number by 1-2 characters should not point to another valid ticket.
Originator: Edna Everage
Comments: [Remigiusz Duszynski] Fit criterion should be more abstract, in the current form it unnecessary constrains other solutions like checksum.
Comments: [Shane Edwards] Rationale is good, the description feels like specific implementation detail. The fit criterion seems to fixate on the solution and agree, should be more abstract.
Comments: [Pete Frost] To be honest I am having difficulty figuring out what the description means. What does "note generate rows" mean?
Comments: [Jose Ruiz] Agree with Pete Frost, the description does not seem to be clear. The fit criterion also goes into implementation details.
